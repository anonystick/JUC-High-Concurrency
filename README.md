## How did you improve performance with JUC-High-Concurrency?

If you are a beginner, I think you should look at the following concepts one by one, remember to go through them one by one.

1 - What is a Thread? Why start with Thread [Here ->](https://youtu.be/cGMBfKBYYgI)

2 - ThreadPool will improve the disadvantages of Thread [Here ->](https://youtu.be/5zCsCR2TquM)

3 - ThreadLocal protects Thread resources [Here ->](https://youtu.be/qqYE9nfXqJo)

4 - Virtual Thread and Platform Thread [Here ->](https://youtu.be/cttaY3UzVws)

And here is the source for VT vs PT (Virtual Thread and Platform Thread).

## How to run and test benchmark

Content and practice here: [ow to run and test benchmark](https://youtu.be/cttaY3UzVws)

And the result you will see how many PT and VT the server will create. When does high CPU occur when using VT.
